                                        it takes to be a software developer then you are wrong. Software developers will
                                        be faced with complex challenges and they have to come up with innovative
                                        solutions on a daily basis.

                                    In context to software developing, problem-solving is an extremely important skill.
                                    A software developer will be dealing with multiple issues with respect to what they
                                    are working on. This could be identifying a bug, understanding errors in
                                    functionality or a specific requirement from clients. They will have to use their
                                    theoretical knowledge, logical thinking and creativity to come up with solutions for
                                    the problems. To generate effective solutions for problems, Developers have to break
                                    down the problem into smaller and more manageable components to create solutions for
                                    them. They will have to collaborate with stakeholders, other developers, designers
                                    to select the best course of action for the problem they are trying to solve.

                                        Software developers will be required to come with creative ideas to solve
                                        problems. Every software is built to solve a particular problem faced by users
                                        and creating such a solution takes a lot of creativity. Writing code in itself
                                        is a creative process. If a software developer is writing code exactly like that
                                        in the previous problem then they just need to copy and paste it, but that’s not
                                        how it works. Every single problem needs a different approach to coding.

                                        Only the best creative minds offer good solutions for problems. This is also a
                                        quality that you can develop. The first and foremost step is to be curious and
                                        be open to ideas. Most often creativity is a result of experimenting a lot of
                                        unique solutions. If you are ready to experiment with unique ideas for the
                                        problem you are dealing with then creativity will automatically come to you.

                                        The whole process of writing code demands strong logical thinking skills. A
                                        programmer must know how to use logic to write code that fills the actual
                                        requirement. This is a quality that comes as a subset to problem-solving. To
                                        solve any problem, individuals will have to break down the big problem into
                                        small chunks of manageable tasks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>From analyzing the problem to formulating potential solutions to them, it needs a
                                        strong logical thinking to approach everything. Developing a strong logical
                                        thinking skill is crucial for any aspiring developer.

                                    Most software developers enter this career by a conventional path of completing
                                    their degree and then applying for a company. This may not  be the most effective
                                    way to enter this industry. While a degree can equip you with basic knowledge, it
                                    will not teach you skills that make you job ready.

                                <p>MNCs are known for mass hiring, they go to colleges and recruit graduates fresh out
                                    of college. The fact that you need to understand here is that they don’t recruit
                                    based on skills. MNCs clearly know that these graduates don't have any skills to
                                    perform in a company. They take these students to their campuses, and then they will
                                    be trained on relevant skills. The main reason why they do this is that they are not
                                    able to find such numerous skilled employees. So, the only option they are left with
                                    is to train candidates and then give them job responsibilities.

                                <p>This is not the case for startups and other small service based companies. MNCs have
                                    all the resources to train students, but this is not a luxury startup and other
                                    small companies can afford. They will be in search of candidates who are skilled and
                                    can start working without prior training. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Degree is no longer a barrier to start your career as a software developer. If you
                                    have the technical skill, and you know how to showcase that to your potential
                                    employer then getting a job is not difficult.
